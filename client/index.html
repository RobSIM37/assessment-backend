      <p>Have a task that requires multiple steps to complete? Visit our <a href="todo.html">To-Do Lists</a> and create a new list, cross off the items as you complete them, and celebrate completing the task!</p>
      <p>Want to track your progress to a goal? Our <a href="progress.html">Progress Meters</a> can help you visualize it! Trying to reach a savings goal? Set a starting value of 0 and your target to your savings goal! Trying to lose some weight? Set the starting value to your current weight and the target to your desired weight! Depending on the desired direction, the meter will show your progress as a growing or shrinking progress bar!</p>
